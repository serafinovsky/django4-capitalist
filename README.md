# django4-capitalist
=================

Fork of python-capitalist for Django 4


A little client for API of [capitalist.net](https://capitalist.net/).

Couple of API methods are implemented because I need only them.
Feel free to ask for additional methods. I'll look into it.

`import_batch_advanced` DOES NOT support certificates with passphrase.
